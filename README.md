# Root Robot Accessories

[Root](https://rootrobotics.com/) is a toy robot that teaches the basics of coding to kids of all ages and skill levels. While Root can do a lot out of the box with its many sensors and outputs, we want to enable you to expand Root's capabilities further with your own accessories or attachments! Here we will share some useful information and materials to help you design and build your Root-based creations using a 3D printer or other tools you may have around. We look forward to seeing what you create!

## Magnetic Attachment Points

Root has 10 small magnets underneath the top surface to help with attaching accessories. These are in a 32mm grid with the North pole of the magnet facing up.
