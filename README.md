# Root Robot Accessories

[Root](https://rootrobotics.com/) is a toy robot that teaches the basics of coding to kids of all ages and skill levels. While Root can do a lot out of the box with its many sensors and outputs, we want to enable you to expand Root's capabilities even further with your own accessories! Here we will share useful information and materials to help you design and build your own Root accessories using a 3D printer or other tools you may have around. Please share your ideas or creations with us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/codewithroot), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/codewithroot), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codewithroot) â€” we look forward to seeing what you make!

## Magnetic Attachment Points

Root has ten small magnets underneath the top surface to help with attaching accessories. These 5mm-diameter magnets are in a 32mm x 32mm grid as shown in the image below. Each magnet has the North pole facing up. You can use these to hold accessories in place by gluing magnets to your accessory that line up with the magnets in Root. (Make sure the magnets are facing the right direction!)
